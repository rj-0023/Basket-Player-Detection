# **Basketball Game Detection & Scoring with YOLO** 🏀🤖  

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks focused on basketball game analysis using **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** object detection.  

## **📌 Features**  
✅ **YOLO Model Training**: Trained from scratch on a custom basketball dataset from **Roboflow**.  
✅ **Game Analysis**: Detects **players, ball, hoop, and teams** to track gameplay.  
✅ **Score Detection**: Identifies when and which team scores a **basket** based on ball and hoop position.  

## **📂 Notebooks**  
1️⃣ **Basketball Game Detection** – Trains a YOLO model using labeled basketball game footage.  
2️⃣ **Game Analysis & Scoring** – Uses the trained model to detect teams, ball, and hoop, and determine when a team scores.  

## **🚀 How to Use**  
1. Clone the repo and install dependencies.  
2. Run the training notebook to train the YOLO model.  
3. Use the second notebook to detect scores in a basketball game.  

💡 *Future improvements include real-time tracking and advanced analytics!*
